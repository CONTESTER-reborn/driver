## üìù About The Project

**CONTESTER.Driver** - is a Docker-based system that runs students' code written on different programming languages.

### üêç Avaliable programming languages:
* Python (Python 3.8)
    * PyPy (7.3.12)
* C++ (GCC Latest)
* PascalABC (Free Pascal 3.2.2)

### ü§î How it works?
Every time user wants to execute some code `Driver` creates appropriate file and Docker container. 
Then, depending on programming language type (compiled of interpreted) it executes all necessary commands.

In order to create a file context manager `FileCreator` is invoked. Based on programming language type it will
create file with unique name and proper extension. Note that after a file is no more needed it is deleted automatically.

As for Docker containers, once again, depending on programming language type `Driver` will create `Container`. 
`Container` is a class inherited either from `CompiledContainer` or `InterpretedContainer`. 
It implements only those methods, that do something very language specific, for example return compilation or execution command.

Now, let's take a look at how `Driver` deals with source file with **C++**  code :
 
1. First of all, source code has to be compiled. To do this, `Driver` will run the following command:
    ```sh
    g++ user-scripts-dir/source-file.cpp -o compiled-files-dir/sourse-file-compiled
    ```
2. As a result, there is *sourse-file-compiled* in  a *compiled-files-dir*. Now, compiled file can be executed:
    ```sh
    sh -c 'echo -e "7 8" | time -f "%e" -o time-stdout-file timeout 2 compiled-files-dir/sourse-file-compiled && cat time-stdout-file'
    ```
  
Here are some explanations of this long command:
* `7 8` is input of the program.
* `time -f "%e" -o time-stdout-file` saves execution time in *time-stdout-file*
* `timeout 2 compiled-files-dir/sourse-file-compiled` ensures that the program is limited to 2 seconds
* `&& cat time-stdout-file`: If no error has occurred, execution time goes to the last line of stdout

After execution of this command, `Driver` will receive `ExecResult` with raw *exit code*, *stdout* and *stderr*.
Then it will thoroughly process this result and return uniform `ProcessedContainerExecutionResult` object.

Examples:
```python
ProcessedContainerExecutionResult(exit_code=0, output='1\n2\n3', execution_time=0.06, error_message='')
ProcessedContainerExecutionResult(
    exit_code=1, 
    output="""File "user-scripts-dir/62b16cbd-b2b7-44cb-8d35-7c4cf1ddd517.py", line 1
    print(
         ^
SyntaxError: '(' was never closed
Command exited with non-zero status 1""", 
    execution_time=0, 
    error_message='Run-Time Error'
)
```

More details about all those mechanisms can be found in the [source code](https://github.com/CONTESTER-reborn/driver/tree/master/driver/libs). 

‚úÖ The vast majority of methods are documented.
